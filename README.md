# YT-Music-DL
Library for downloading and tagging music from youtube music

I made this in my off time ... probably going to rewrite it some time soon but figured I'd upload it anyway.

Use `MusicDL.ArtistDL()` to download an entire artist's discography
Use `MusicDL.PlaylistDL()` to download one album
and use `MusicDL.YoutubeDL()` to download just one song ... actually just don't use YoutubeDL lol. You'd need a song id instead of a url ... again ... I wrote this in my free time for one purpose and it isn't writen the best so I'll probably redo it sometime 'soon' 


## Examples

I'll do this later
