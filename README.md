# YT-Music-DL
Library for downloading and tagging music from youtube music

I made this in my off time ... probably going to rewrite it some time soon but figured I'd upload it anyway.


## Usage/info

Use MusicDL.DownloadURL(url,path) to download whatever music you want

the dynamic path usage is as follows:

`[Artist]` - the name of the song's artist

`[Album]` - the name of the song's album

`[SongNum]` - the index of the song in the album

`[SongName]` - the song's name


## Examples

I'll do this later
